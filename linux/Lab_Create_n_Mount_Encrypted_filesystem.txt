		Create and Mount an Encrypted Filesystem
Introduction
One of the developers in your organization is going to be working on a server with sensitive data that is covered by various compliance regulations. Your corporate security policy states that user information must be on encrypted partitions.

You have been provided with credentials and connection information for a new instance that will be used for this work. You will be creating a new partition from an additional disk provisioned to this system, 20 GB in size. Once you create the partition, you will need to take steps to secure the contents that will be placed on it.

Using the appropriate encryption steps, you will format the filesystem and provide the necessary configuration commands to make it available with the right encryption/decryption commands. This will NOT be mounted on boot, it will need to remain a manual mount/decryption process. The developer has asked for the mount point to be a directory called /mnt/enc_fs. Once you verify the encryption and decryption works and protect the filesystem, you can turn it over for the development team.

Solution
Begin by logging in to the lab server using the credentials provided on the hands-on lab page:

 ssh cloud_user@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
Become the root user:

 sudo su -
Partition Created for Use as Encrypted Filesystem
Verify that the server has the support needed to install an encrypted filesystem:

 grep -i config_dm_crypt /boot/config-$(uname -r)
Install the necessary packages:

 yum install cryptsetup vim
View the device names available to the system:

 lsblk
Create the necessary partition:

 fdisk /dev/xvdg
Answer the following prompts:

 Command (m for help): n
 Partition Type: p
 Partition number (1-4, default 1): Press Enter to accept the default
 First sector: Press Enter to accept the default
 Last sector: Press Enter to accept the default
 Command: p
 Command: w
Use cryptsetup to encrypt that device:

 cryptsetup -y luksFormat /dev/xvdg1
Answer the following prompts:

 Are you sure: YES
 Enter passphrase: linux academy & cloud assessments
 Verify passphrase: linux academy & cloud assessments
Open the encrypted partition:

 cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/xvdg1 mySecret
Enter the passphrase:

 linux academy & cloud assessments
Format the partition:

mkfs -t ext4 /dev/mapper/mySecret
Mount Point for Filesystem and Mounted
Create a mountpoint:

 mkdir /mnt/enc_fs
Mount the filesystem:

 mount /dev/mapper/mySecret /mnt/enc_fs
Verify:

 ls -la /mnt/enc_fs
Test adding a file:

 touch /mnt/enc_fs/test.txt
Conclusion
Congratulations â€” you've completed this hands-on lab!

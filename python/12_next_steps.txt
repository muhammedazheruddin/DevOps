Thank you for taking the time to go through this course! I hope that you learned a lot and I want to hear about it. If you could please take a moment to rate the course, it will help me know what is working and what is not. Now that you have a solid programming foundation with Python, there are a lot of doors open to you to continue your learning.

Here are some courses that I think you should consider taking that would leverage your knowledge of Python while teaching you something new:

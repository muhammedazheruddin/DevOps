An important step in the journey toward a full CI/CD Pipeline is containerization. Containers make it easier to implement some of the automation features involved in orchestration. In this lesson, we will discuss what containers are and why we want to use them in the context of a CI/CD Pipeline. We will also introduce Docker, the container tool of choice for this course.

In order to utilize Docker within the context of a CI/CD Pipeline, you need some basic knowledge of its concepts and how it is used. In this lesson, we will cover some of the essential concepts of Docker, such as images, containers, and registries. We will also demonstrate a few of the common commands that you will use to interact with Docker.
After completing this lesson, you will know how to build a Docker image and publish it to Docker Hub. You will also know how to run a container using a Docker image.

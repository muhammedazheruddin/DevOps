So far, you have learned how to implement a deployment of an app directly to a server using a Jenkine Pipeline. Now that you have learned how to dockerize the app, it is time to dockerize the CD process as well.
This lesson will discuss one way we can configure a Jenkins pipeline to deploy a dockerized app as a contained. This lesson demonstrates how to build a Jenkins pipeline that builds the app as a Docker image, puhes the image to a registry, pulls the image to the production server, and deploys the app as a container on the production server.
After completing this lesson, you will be able to apply the concepts of Jenkins pipeline automation to a dockerized app.

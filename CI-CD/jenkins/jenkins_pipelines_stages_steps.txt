The basic structure of a Jenkins pipeline consists of stages and steps. You need to be familiar with these concepts in order to build your own Jenkins pipelines.
This lesson discusses these two concepts and walks you through a sample Jenkinsfile that uses a stage and a few steps to implement a CI build.
After completing this lesson, you will be ready to proceed toward implementing more complex functionality within a Jenkins pipeline.


When building Jenkins pipelines, you may need to consult the steps reference: https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/

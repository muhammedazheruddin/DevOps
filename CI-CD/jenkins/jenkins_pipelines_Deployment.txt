In order to succeed with continuous delivery and continuous deployment, deployment automation is essential. In this lesson, we will be implementing automated deployments within a Jenkins pipeline. We will create pipeline stages to automatically deploy to a staging server and a production server. After completing this lesson, you will have some familiarity with how automated deployment can be implementing using Jenkins Pipelines.
